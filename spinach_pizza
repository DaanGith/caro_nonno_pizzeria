* The Spinach Pizza Topping

The topping is super easy and uses only 5 ingredients; tomato sauce, 
fresh baby spinach, Gorgonzola cheese, red onion and mozzarella. 
For the tomato sauce, you can either use my Authentic Italian Tomato Sauce 
if you want to go all out or simply use pureed tomatoes (passata) out of the jar.

* How to Make Spinach Pizza with Gorgonzola & Red Onion - Step By Step

- Add the fresh spinach to a large pan with a little olive oil and wilt on a medium heat. Once wilted remove from the pan and set aside (photos 1 & 2).

- Next, roll out the pizza dough to fit a large baking tray. Dust the tray with a little semolina (or regular flour) and place the rolled out pizza crust on top. Top with pureed tomatoes (passata) and both cheeses (photo 3).

- Scatter the wilted spinach and slices of red onion over the top (photo 4) then bake in the oven for 10 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese has melted.

- Other Toppings that Would Work Well with Spinach

You don't have to stick to red onion and gorgonzola, you can opt for different toppings such as mushrooms, thinly sliced bell peppers, marinated artichokes and any kind of cheese you like. It's all about having fun and being creative.
