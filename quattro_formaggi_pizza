Quattro Formaggi Pizza (Four Cheese)
(https://www.insidetherustickitchen.com/quattro-formaggi-pizza/)

A REAL four cheese pizza is made with four incredible and delicious 
cheeses on a light and crispy pizza crust spread with tomato sauce. 
It's just amazing!

* Ingredients you need:

First, you'll need to prepare the pizza dough which needs 
around 3-4 hours to prove (at least). To make it you just need; 
Flour (preferably Italian Tipo 00), fast-action yeast, salt, 
olive oil and warm water.

For the four cheese topping you'll need; tomato sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola, 
Parmigiano Reggiano, and goat cheese. You can replace the cheese with any of 
your favourite cheeses but I'd say that mozzarella is pretty important.

* How to make Quattro Formaggi Pizza - step by step:

First, put the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl making sure to put the salt and yeast at opposite sides (photo 1).

Add the water and olive oil and mix together to form a rough dough (photos 2 & 3).

Shape the dough into a ball then knead on a lightly floured 
surface for around 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and 
elastic (photo 4).

After kneading shape the dough into a ball and place in a 
large clean bowl lightly greased with olive oil. Cover with 
plastic wrap and sit the dough in a dry warm place for 2-3 hours 
or until tripled in size (photos 5 & 6).

Once the dough has risen, knock the air out by pressing 
down on it with your fist. Divide in half and shape into two 
separate balls ready for baking.
