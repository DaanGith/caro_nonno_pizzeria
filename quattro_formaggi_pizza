Quattro Formaggi Pizza (Four Cheese)

A REAL four cheese pizza is made with four incredible and delicious 
cheeses on a light and crispy pizza crust spread with tomato sauce. 
It's just amazing!

Ingredients you need

First, you'll need to prepare the pizza dough which needs 
around 3-4 hours to prove (at least). To make it you just need; 
Flour (preferably Italian Tipo 00), fast-action yeast, salt, 
olive oil and warm water.

For the four cheese topping you'll need; tomato sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola, 
Parmigiano Reggiano, and goat cheese. You can replace the cheese with any of 
your favourite cheeses but I'd say that mozzarella is pretty important.
