Taleggio Mushroom Pizza

But recently I've been making my mushroom pizza with one of the most delicious Italian cheeses...Taleggio! 
It's rich and tangy, melts beautifully and keeps its flavour when melted which is super important!

Ingredient notes and substitutions

- Homemade pizza dough - this is our basic recipe for making pizzas at home. 
  It's easy and delicious! The dough will make enough for 2 large tray pizzas or 3-4 smaller round ones.

- Mushrooms - Crimini mushrooms (chestnut mushrooms UK) work best for this recipe.
- Thyme - use fresh thyme, not dried. if you can't find it then a 
  little dried oregano would be a good alternative.
- Tomato passata - known as tomato puree in the US, it's great for using as pizza sauce. 
  You can use it straight from the jar as it is or mix it with a little salt and olive oil which I often do
